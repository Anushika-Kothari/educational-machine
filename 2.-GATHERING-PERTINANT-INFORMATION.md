|9.|TOUCHSCREEN|![](https://donteatalone.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/touch-screen-blog-e1599577334448.png)|

Miko 3 is equipped with a wide-angle HD camera, time of flight range sensor, and odometric sensors that help the robot to map distance seamlessly and to avoid edges and obstacles. The expansive touchscreen provides a healthy alternative to playtime on smartphones and tablets. The Mikonnect video calling feature keeps kids and parents connected safely and seamlessly. The MIKO 3 comes with an IPS display which can be used for video calling, high performance speakers, rubber wheels, and ABS body, which is claimed to be engineered to be impact-resistant,non-toxic, and built to last.
**HOW IT WORKS**
To connect with kids on a highly personal level and facilitate learning, Miko 3 was built around proprietary emotional intelligence; a complex conversational and multilingual ai framework; edge and hybrid speech and vision recognition; and an active learning and behavioral analysis engine. 

This smart robot toy features an autonomous navigation system with an integrated wide-angle HD camera and odometric sensors to measure distances and detect edges.  

Miko 3 also has a touchscreen that kids can use to improve learning experiences and connect with the family, parents can video chat with their kids. Miko 3 needs to stay connected to Wi-Fi to give kids access to amazing games and educational content. Kids can talk to their smart bot, ask questions and get answers. 

 **ADVANTAGES OF MIKO 3**
* It can talk, respond, educate, and provide entertainment.
* It can understand your child’s needs, emotions, and likes and dislikes.
* It helps in creative learning and better understanding.
* It also helps to develop a better imagination and problem solving mind.
* Kid learns with playing.
* Parents don't need to pay attention while they are working when their kids are playing ('learning') with such robots. 
* It is made up of a rugged ABS body, thus needing less maintenance.

 **LIMITATIONS**
* Miko has a set-up process that is fairly easy, but it can be a difficult task for some non-techy parents.
* Thick carpets, glass, water, and wet surfaces should be avoided.
